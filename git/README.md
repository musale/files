# Getting Started With Git

## Introduction
Git is a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).

### Getting Started
You need to have git installed in your machine. I am going to use linux so skip this part if you've it installed. If not, Google it based on your linux distribution.

### Configuring Git
Git needs some basic configuring so that later on when you're working on projects and using it, you don't have to specify obvious information all the time.
